6.141-Challenge (MASLAB 2015)
=============================

The Core.Overload class is the program's entry point.

By default, the robot will enter the "ExploreState" and drive to a random stack of cubes.
Since the RRT doesn't do well, with BROKEN PATH's (driving on top of obstacles), it will
most likely go to one place correctly, then stop...  The sensors and motors are simulated,
which means this project has NO dependencies :D  It's just plain old Java!
